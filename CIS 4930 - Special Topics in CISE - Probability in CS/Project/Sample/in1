#    workload distribution: 
#             1 - exponential; mean is calculated based on System Load
#             2 - pareto; Workload parameters = alpha and K; alpha > 1, K > 0
#                 Only alpha is provided in the input file.
#                 Workload mean is calculated by: System Load / Request Rate
#                 Parameter K is calculaed using: mean=alpha*K/(alpha-1) 
#
Total Requests: 1000000
Total Time: 1
#
# number of requests per second
Request Rate: 1000.0
#
# System Load is with respect to the transmission rate of the FIFO queue
# for stable queue, load should be in (0,1)
# the mean of workload of a request is calculated by: System Load / Request Rate
System Load: 0.9
#
# server rate relative to the FIFO transmission rate
# the sever service time of a request is: workload/Server Rate
Server Rate: 0.001
#
# 1 - EXPONENTIAL; 2 - PARETO
Workload Distribution: 2
#
# Pareto_Alpha > 1. Only useful when the workload distribution is PARETO. 
Pareto Alpha: 2
